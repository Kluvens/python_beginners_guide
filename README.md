# Why Python
## Python history
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Viskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
which was inspired by SETL, 
capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
## Python 2 and Python 3
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, and Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008.
As of January 1st, 2020, no new bug reports, fixes or changes will be made to Python 2 and Python 2 is no longer supported.

There are several major differences between Python 2 and Python 3:
- Python 3 syntax is simpler and easily understandable whereas Python 2 syntax is comparatively difficult to understand.
- Python 3 default storing of strings is Unicode whereas Python 2 stores need to define Unicode string value with “u.”
- Python 3 value of variables never changes whereas in Python 2 value of the global variable will be changed while using it inside for-loop.
- Python 3 exceptions should be enclosed in parenthesis while Python 2 exceptions should be enclosed in notations.
- Python 3 rules of ordering comparisons are simplified whereas Python 2 rules of ordering comparison are complex.
- Python 3 offers Range() function to perform iterations whereas, In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations.
## Why Python is popular
1. Python is easy to learn and use which means Python can have higher productivity
2. Python is handy for web development purposes
3. Python is extensively used in data science and artificial intelligence
4. Python has multiple libraries and frameworks
5. Python can be used in ML tool
6. Python has a highly supportive community
7. Python programs or portable
## Why Python is slow
Unlike native languages like C/C++, Python code gets interpreted at runtime instead of being compiled to native code at compile time. Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code we write must go through many, many stages of abstraction before it can become executable machine code.

Python code is first compiled into python Byte Code. The Byte Code interpreter conversion happens internally and most of it is hidden from the developer.Byte code is platform-independent and lower-level programming. Compilation of byte code is to ramp up the execution of source code. The source code compiled to byte code is then executed in Python’s virtual machine one by one, to carry out the operations. The virtual machine is an internal component of Python. Internally Python code is interpreted during run time rather than being compiled to native code hence it is a bit slower.

## Python with Regular expression
``` python
import re
```
**Information:**
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.
For example, we may want to check if an input is an email.
Since every email must be bounded by the pattern, we can use regular expression to help us check this.
